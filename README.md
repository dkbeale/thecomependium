# The Compendium Web App

This project is a work in progress

## project

This is a personal web app project called the compendium, 
a site that will allow users to search information to speed up
play at the game table. I also plan to implement a character 
creation section where players can create and save characters
easily and use it as a replacement for the traditional paper 
character sheets.

### `To be implemented`

1) Finish the nav section
2) Spell section, including a search function and styling
3) A races section covering the playable DnD races
4) Classes section, with a break down of DnD classes
5) Character creation section
